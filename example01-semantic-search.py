# Understanding Vectors and Embeddings in Vector Databases
# ========================================================
#
# Vector: A fixed-length array of numbers (e.g., [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ...]) that represents data
#        mathematically in high-dimensional space.
#
# Embedding: The process and result of converting data (like text) into vectors. For example:
#           Text: "I love dogs" -> Vector: [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ...]
#           ChromaDB uses the 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model to create
#           384-dimensional vectors for each text.

# Initialize the client
chroma_client = chromadb.Client()

# Create a collection - ChromaDB will use default embedding function
collection = chroma_client.create_collection(name="example01_collection")

                      "inertial mass is a consequence of nature. The weak form, known for centuries, relates to "

TEXT_ABOUT_IT = ("Some online sites offer customers the ability to use a six-digit code which randomly changes every "

                 "numbers based on the current time. This means that every thirty seconds only a certain array of "
                 "numbers validate access.")
